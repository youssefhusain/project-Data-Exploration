# Experience Level Distribution

This graph illustrates the distribution of experience levels among freelancers. Here's what stands out:

ðŸ“Š The distribution shows a clear trend where the count of freelancers decreases as experience levels increase, with the majority being at lower experience levels.

ðŸš¨ Interestingly, there is a noticeable spike at certain experience levels, indicating a higher concentration of freelancers at those stages.

This pattern can be explained by:

ðŸ¤” Many freelancers start their careers at lower experience levels, leading to a higher count in those categories.

ðŸ’¡ As freelancers gain more experience, some may transition to other roles or industries, resulting in fewer individuals at higher experience levels.

Key Insight: ðŸ’¡ The distribution highlights that while many freelancers begin their careers at lower experience levels, the number decreases as experience grows, reflecting career progression and potential industry shifts.

ðŸ’° Average Price by Experience Level
This graph shows how freelancers at different experience levels charge for their services. Here's what stands out:

ðŸ“Š Junior, Mid-Junior, Senior, Mid-Senior, and Expert freelancers follow a relatively normal pricing trend, with prices increasing as experience grows.

ðŸš¨ However, Beginners charge more than expected, which is unusual given their limited experience.

This anomaly can be explained by:

ðŸ¤” Beginners often lack the knowledge of market rates and may overestimate their value.

ðŸ’¡ Inexperienced freelancers might also be less aware of competitive pricing strategies.

Key Insight: ðŸ’¡ While experience generally dictates pricing, beginners often charge more due to a lack of market awareness.
