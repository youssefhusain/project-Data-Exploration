ðŸ’° Average Price by Experience Level
This graph shows how freelancers at different experience levels charge for their services. Here's what stands out:

ðŸ“Š Junior, Mid-Junior, Senior, Mid-Senior, and Expert freelancers follow a relatively normal pricing trend, with prices increasing as experience grows.

ðŸš¨ However, Beginners charge more than expected, which is unusual given their limited experience.

This anomaly can be explained by:

ðŸ¤” Beginners often lack the knowledge of market rates and may overestimate their value.

ðŸ’¡ Inexperienced freelancers might also be less aware of competitive pricing strategies.

Key Insight: ðŸ’¡ While experience generally dictates pricing, beginners often charge more due to a lack of market awareness.
