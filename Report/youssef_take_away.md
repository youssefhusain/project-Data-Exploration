Setting the right rate is crucial. If it’s too low, you may undervalue your work; if it’s too high, you might lose potential clients.

- Research average rates for your skills and experience on platforms like Upwork or Freelancer. For example, freelance developers with 3-5 years of experience typically charge between **$30-$75 per hour**.
- Start with a competitive rate and gradually increase it as you gain experience and positive reviews.
- Avoid setting your rate too low, as it may suggest a lack of experience or quality.
