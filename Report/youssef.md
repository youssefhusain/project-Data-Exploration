### 3. Dividing Data into Rated and Non-Rated Freelancers
Another critical step was dividing the dataset into two subsets:
- **Rated Freelancers**: Freelancers with available ratings.
- **Non-Rated Freelancers**: Freelancers without ratings.

This division was crucial for understanding patterns within the data. The visualization below highlights this process:
